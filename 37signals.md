Up until 48 hours ago, I’d never maintained a portfolio.

I could tell you this site was built using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and a whole lot of markdown. Or that I taught myself how to use Spline for animations. But honestly, the tech isn’t the point—the end result is.

Here’s what matters: in just 48 hours, I shipped a personal website, a blog with two posts, a 3D animation, 1,500 words of copy, a resume, and even a 3D-printed monitor arm.

All because I want to work for you: 37signals.<a href="#footnote"><sup>†</sup><a>

Sure, I could talk about my design heroes, Dieter Rams and Don Norman. That good design is aesthetic, and all affordances deserve a signifier. But I’d rather use this time to tell you what I believe.

We now live in a world where one person can produce more than an entire team.

But just because you can doesn’t mean you always should. Knowing what to build matters more than ever.

Call me old-fashioned, but my favorite design framework is still the Double Diamond.

![](/assets/images/double-diamond.jpg)

The Double Diamond helps you realize that tackling the problem space is just as important as the solution.

But while anyone can come up with solutions, finding the right problem is much harder.

Just like in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, “42” is the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, but the question (the problem) remains unknown.

Which brings me to my most fundamental design belief:

**Good design is curious.**

Being curious means asking the right questions. Those questions are how we identify the right problem and, ultimately, the right solution.

**And this is what I can bring to 37signals.**

My whole life is built around curiosity. I was that kid who skipped class to read the textbook on my own. In elementary school, teachers told my mother I ask too many questions. 

When my cousins said curiosity killed the cat, I yelled back, “Good thing cats have nine lives.”

Today, I’m still that curious kid.

# Why do I <img src="/assets/design_assets/heart.svg" alt="heart" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-top: -4px;"> the web?
I am a product of the internet.

When I was 12, my cousin was working on his MFA at Parsons. He was using an Arduino to build magic drumsticks. When the drumsticks hit different colors, they would play different sounds—a whole drum kit on the go.

I was amazed. I asked him, “How does it work?”

He got up from his desk, sat me down in front of his laptop, and said, “You have Google, go figure it out.”

The web has been my home ever since. It’s been the answer to my curiosity.

In college, I purposely became a generalist. I majored in business because it let me combine minors in Communication Design and Web Technologies.

I had this grand idea of legacy—that I wanted my legacy to be based on building something millions of people used every day.

Tech, design, business—I wanted them all. Why? Because if I wanted that legacy, I needed to know I could create it, ship it, and sell it.

> “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often better than a master of one.”

For the past few years, I’ve been the Director of Product at Monarch Nascent——a game studio.

I joined them to follow my childhood dream: Build the next Pokémon!

What a crazy idea! A team of 20 people attempting to recreate the most recognizable brand in history.

It was a pipe dream, but sometimes you need to dream big.

Have big goals—you may miss, but you land somewhere better than most people could imagine. And that’s exactly what happened.

We didn’t rival Pokémon…yet, but I did achieve another goal. I shipped something over 1 million people played. In fact, we shipped two titles, and one had a D30 retention rate that would make Zuck jealous.

# So why 37signals? Why now?

To be frank, I always thought Monarch Gaming would be my last job.

My plan had been to return to my entrepreneurial roots within the next two years, but then I was clearing out my inbox.

This position is the only position I will apply to. It is the only one I would consider.

When I was in college, I read *Rework*, and it immediately flipped a switch in me. Since then, I’ve advocated at every company I’ve worked at to implement the framework Jason and David laid out: from remote best practices to asynchronous work to team size.

In fact, the current benefits at Monarch came from me forwarding the 37signals site to our founders.

But I’ve never been able to get a company to embody all or even 60% of those principles.

I believe being part of the 37signals team would allow me to finally experience if everything I advocate is truly effective.

# So why hire me? 

I can code, I can write, and I can ship. And when I ship, I can ship to millions.

I take accountability for my work, and I always act as an owner.

If you agree that good design is solving the right problems, let’s talk.
