## Stay Connected, One Waffle at a Time

Waffle is a React Native iOS app designed to help friends maintain meaningful connections through weekly asynchronous video messages. In a world of instant messaging and endless notifications, Waffle takes a different approach â€“ encouraging thoughtful, scheduled check-ins that expire after 7 days.

## Key Features

- **1-to-1 Video Messaging**: Send personal video messages to close friends
- **7-Day Expiration**: Messages disappear after a week, encouraging regular communication
- **Streak Tracking**: Build and maintain communication streaks with friends
- **Apple Sign-In & SMS Verification**: Secure and seamless authentication
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean, distraction-free design focused on the conversation

## Why Waffle?

Traditional messaging apps create pressure for instant responses and can lead to conversation fatigue. Waffle embraces asynchronous communication, giving you time to craft meaningful messages while maintaining regular contact with the people who matter most.

## Technical Details

- Built with React Native and Expo SDK 53
- Firebase backend for authentication, data storage, and cloud functions
- Expo Router for file-based navigation
- NativeWind for Tailwind-style styling in React Native
- iOS-focused development (requires iOS 15.1+)

## Planned Features

- AI-powered reply suggestions to help start conversations
- Conversation starters for when you don't know what to say
- Relationship insights based on communication patterns
- Enhanced video editing capabilities
