Sometime last year, my X feed was flooded with horror stories about unexpected six-figure Vercel bills.

Under every thread was a comment about using a VPS.

Especially one's under $5/mo.

I wanted to see how true this was, so I launched my own server to host some projects.

While experimenting with Docker was fun, I already missed the simplicity and convenience of cloud hosting. 

Yet, according to the X mob, the choice was clear: use a VPS or face bankruptcy!

Fortunately for my wallet, I soon discovered [Coolify](https://coolify.io/)â€”an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Vercel.

Since then, I've been diving deeper into the world of self-hosted services, from personal cloud storage to home automation. In fact, both [Prompt Cost](/projects/promptcost) and [Apartment Monitor](/projects/apartment-monitor) leveraged Coolify's one-click deploys. 

## General Takeaways
The benefits of self hosting became clear to me: more control, reduced costs, & better understanding of the underlying technology. I plan to keep it up for future projects.
