A few months ago, my X feed was flooded with horror stories about unexpected six-figure Vercel bills.

Under every thread was a comment claiming "you should have used a $5/month VPS".

I wanted to see how true this was, so I launched my own server to host some projects—and had a blast.

I’ve since been exploring the world of self-hosted services, from personal cloud storage to home automation. This project documents my setup, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.
