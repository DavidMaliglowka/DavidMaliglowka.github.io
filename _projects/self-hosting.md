Sometime last year, my X feed was flooded with horror stories about unexpected six-figure Vercel bills.

Under every thread was a comment about using a VPS.

Especially one's under $5/mo!

Consider my interest piqued. I wanted to see how true this was, so I launched my own server to host some projects—and had a blast.

*Side note: I'm sure this seems like a no-brainer to some, but I'd grown accustomed to the ease of cloud hosting for quickly spinning things up without worry.*

Yet, according to the X mob, the choice was clear: use a VPS or face bankruptcy!

Fortunately for my wallet, I soon discovered [Coolify](https://coolify.io/)—an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Vercel.

Since then, I've been diving deeper into the world of self-hosted services, from personal cloud storage to home automation. In fact, both [Prompt Cost](/projects/promptcost) and [Apartment Monitor](/projects/apartment-monitor) leveraged Coolify's one-click deploys.
