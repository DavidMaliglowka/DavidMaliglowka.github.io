"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Can do!"

Ever wished you could spawn an army of focused, task-specific agents to turn your product ideas into reality? That's exactly what Project Meeseeks does.

## The Philosophy

Like their blue, interdimensional counterparts, our Meeseeks agents exist for one purpose: to complete their assigned task and then vanish. No existential dread, no scope creep—just pure, focused execution.

## How It Works

Project Meeseeks takes your Product Requirements Document and breaks it down into atomic, manageable tasks. Each task spawns its own dedicated "sub-agent"—a Designer Meeseeks, a Frontend Meeseeks, a Backend Meeseeks—all working in parallel in isolated git worktrees.

The beauty? These agents are short-lived. They pop into existence, execute their specific task with laser focus, and disappear once complete. No long-running contexts, no confused agents trying to remember what they were doing three hours ago.

## Technical Architecture

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Leverages Claude Code CLI to spawn and manage specialized AI agents
- **Isolated Execution**: Each agent works in its own git worktree, preventing conflicts
- **Task-Master Integration**: Sophisticated workflow management ensures smooth handoffs between agents
- **Rapid Iteration**: From PRD to production code faster than you can say "existence is pain"

## Requirements

- Node ≥ 18
- Python ≥ 3.11  
- Git ≥ 2.40
- A tolerance for Rick and Morty references

## Current Status

Early stages but promising. The foundation is laid for a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development that actually respects the single-responsibility principle.
