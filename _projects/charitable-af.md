Picture 2020. The world shuts down.

You're locked in your house. You see incredible first responders doing their part to help. You start asking yourself: What can I do?

Well, if you're me, you might be inclined to make software. You might also lean toward supporting various non-profits based on past experiences.

So that's exactly what we did. My friend Chai and I set out to build a donation site that we hoped could be as viral as the virus itself.

CharitableAF was a small social experiment where donors had to recruit a friend to match their donation—or else their contribution wouldn't go through.

We crafted a landing page that was very different from most products, it made you read it. A mini-personal sales letter for good.

We built a referral system that texted you updates every time someone used your link, showering you with confetti and encouraging GIFs to celebrate your progress.

We adopted Vercel's OG-image tool—before Vercel became Vercel. 
We used it to create custom Open Graph cards that announced, "David challenged you ⚔️". We used the referrer's name in the image to personalize the outreach & spark intrigue the moment their friend received the text. 

It showed promise. About 40% of visitors who reached our homepage started a donation. People shared enthusiastically, sending it on average to five friends each.

But there was a hurdle: the average referral chain only stretched about four people deep.

Ultimately, people's interest in donating specifically to COVID-19 relief faded faster than we had hoped. Despite its potential, CharitableAF never quite reached the critical mass we dreamed of—but there are certainly worse ways to spend your time.
