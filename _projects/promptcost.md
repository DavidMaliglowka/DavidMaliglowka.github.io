A tool to help devs calculate the cost of their LLM prompts.

## Why?
I got interested in in LLM tokenization work after watching King Karpathy ðŸ‘‘ drop his [3-hour lecture on building LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) (worth the watch).

To get familiar with the concepts, I developed this tool. It ended up being pretty useful when building apps that leverage AI features.

It supports multiple OpenAI models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and others (more to come), providing real-time cost estimation based on token counts.
