A tool to help techies calculate the cost of their LLM prompts.

## Why?
I got interested in how tokenizers work after watching King Karpathy ðŸ‘‘ drop his [3-hour lecture on LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) (worth the watch). 

To get familiar with the concepts, I made this tool. It ended up being pretty useful when building apps that leverage AI.


It supports multiple OpenAI models (more to come), with real-time cost estimation.
