Have you ever had your landlord raise your rent?

If you nodded yes, you’re not alone.

Most of the time, you have an opportunity to negotiate. But who holds the cards: the single tenant who doesn’t want to move, or the complex that manages hundreds—or even thousands—of rental agreements every year?

The main difference between you and them—besides owning a building—is data.

So, what if you could access the same data they have? What if you knew their occupancy rate, their average rental price, and even the rates of their competitors across the street?

Well, that’s why I built Apartment Monitor—a simple tool that tracks pricing changes at my apartment complex and similar units in my area.

The goal is simple: to have data on my side when it’s time to negotiate.
