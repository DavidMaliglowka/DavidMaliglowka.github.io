1. READ the complete README.md file:
   - Start with view_file lines 0-199
   - Continue reading in 200-line chunks until you reach the end of the file
   - Look for end markers or check if content cuts off mid-sentence to determine if more chunks are needed
   - Do NOT proceed until you have read the entire README.md from start to finish

2. THEN run `git ls-files` to get the full project structure and file listing.

3. AFTER reviewing the git ls-files output, check if any files ending in "-requirements.md" exist in the project.

4. IF any -requirements.md files are found, read each one COMPLETELY:
   - Start with lines 0-199 for each requirements file
   - Continue reading in 200-line chunks until you reach the end
   - Look for end markers (like "*End of [filename]*") or incomplete sentences
   - Ensure you have captured the entire file content before moving on

5. VERIFICATION: Before proceeding with any other tasks, confirm you have:
   ✓ Read the complete README.md (all chunks)
   ✓ Executed git ls-files successfully
   ✓ Read all -requirements.md files completely (all chunks for each file)

CRITICAL: The view_file tool only shows ~200 lines at a time. You MUST read files in sequential chunks to get complete context. Do not summarize or skip sections - read every line of these critical files.
