Let’s get one thing perfectly clear: Words are power. 

They create hope. They inspire. They move nations.

In our day-to-day lives, this simple fact often goes unnoticed. Too many words are used too often. But in truth, we only need two words to paint a vivid picture in someone’s mind.

Don’t believe me? I’ll prove it.

**"I do."**

Two little words—and you either recall a romantic vow or vow never to do it again.
But this essay isn’t about answering a question. It’s about embracing a command, a belief, a mantra—something you repeat to yourself, guiding the way you live each day.


Two words changed my life. There's a good chance they'll change yours too.


These words are short, clear, and powerful:

**"Be useful."**

Ten years ago, I read [a blog post](https://vanschneider.com/blog/be-useful/) by Tobias van Schneider that stuck with me like glue. Tobias wrote that whenever he felt lost, confused, or unsure, he reminded himself of those two simple words: Be useful.


At first, it sounded too easy. But simple things stick. And this simplicity completely shifted how I saw everything—my work, my friends, my family, my entire life.

It made me realize the truth:

Two words can change everything.

In fact, they're the reason I'm writing to you right now. For 10 years, I had wanted to share my thoughts online but never did—until I embraced another two-word mantra:

**"Just Start."**

Two words got me moving. Two words gave me purpose.

Now it’s your turn:

What two words will change your life?
